### Features

* Added ability to use external variable inside of mappings, read [Parameterized mappings](https://github.com/DevTeamHub/QueryMappings/wiki/Parameterized-Mapping) for details.
* Added ability to inject EF Context into mapping, read [Query mappings](https://github.com/DevTeamHub/QueryMappings/wiki/Query-Mapping) for more details.
* Both, external variables and context, can be used together: [Paremeterized Query mappings](https://github.com/DevTeamHub/QueryMappings/wiki/Parameterized-Query-Mappings).
* **Exception messages** have been significantly improved, added a lot of descriptive messages that should help to understand problems with mappings. 
* **Project documentation** added [here](https://github.com/DevTeamHub/QueryMappings/wiki).
* **Unit tests** added to cover most of possible usages of the library. Unit tests also can be used as additional documentation and examples for the project.
